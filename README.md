# Project structure

This repository contains a simple skeleton of a web page which contains a REST service implemented in Node and a simple Web client that invokes the service.

## Credits

This skeleton is based on a [similar skeleton](https://github.com/Arquisoft/radarin_0) created by [Pablo González](https://github.com/pglez82) which is a bit more complex because the web client is implemented as a [React application](https://reactjs.org/) and the server contains monitoring and load testing.
